*Agenda #1 says "analyzer tasks-MDA model" in case you can't see from the glare.


Analyzers went to OH and brain dumped, then found out the critical path, then took one point on the critical path and
applied SMART goals to it. We figured out how to turn a large project into a smaller task using SMART goals.

Met with group on Saturday to talk about roadblocks, ask questions, and potential future goals and meeting times.


#Roadblocks:
How do we arithmatically add a float to a datetime?

-Float is alarm length from MDA model

-Datetime pandas object is what we're receiving as data

##Tackling Roadblock: 
Ask Chris and Aaron through Github

##Future problems

What is Tau? And how do we use it in the MDA model?
