### Theory behind Luen model

M0: magnitude we predict

M1: smallest magnitude that will turn alarm on

-Set a level that won't turn on alarm until magnitude passes threshold

           W(M:alpha) = (c1/m1)ku^M if m>m1
           
                      = 0 otherwise

-Vary M1 to sweep across alpha

-Idea is for lower levels of alpha the window is going to be smaller

-u and c1 are two free parameters

### Visualization code

-Installed ggplot for plotting in python, can also be used for R

```sudo pip install ggplot```

-Here is a helpful link for anyone interested in working with ggplot: http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/ggplot-for-python.html

-Discussed what format we want our plot to be in. Whether we should stick with ggplot or do another type of plot

-Teamwork of pseudo-coding on a whiteboard

-PERFECTION IS OUR ENEMY


### Roadblocks

-Reproduceability: installing all of the packages that we had to install at the beginning of the semester in order to use ggplot

-Trying to use ggplot on ipython notebook was a tough roadblock

-Python datetimes can't be converted to ggplot units

-Can't take last 5 earthquakes of the year to make things more simple

-Don't use round() in python because results can be "surprising" and don't use floor() because it doesn't give us what we are looking for

   -numpy will bin magnitudes for us

-Got sidetracked when trying to learn new tools for ggplot. Started to make histograms when we should be making other plots. Disi kept us in check.

### Future goals

- Make a plot with ggplot that takes binned magnitude for x and time for y and produces a data frame 

- For each earthquake: in its magnitude bin, plot aftershock times (limit to 5 aftershocks for now)

Data-frame:

(m1, t11)

(m1, t12)

(m1, t13)

(m1, t14)

(m1, t15)

(m1, t12)

(m1, t21)

(m1, t22)
# ...

(mX, tX5)
