Presentation Notes

1) Create a skeleton function that takes parameters for MDA model and outputs things

   MDA function is not fine-tuned yet, set dummy variables for u and tau for now

2) magnitude sample data is used from last homework

3) talked about pandas datetime compared to python datetime

4) we chose python datetime because we had to calculate alarm duration and add to original date. 

5) it was easy to do with python datetime and hard to do with pandas datetime. because we can do arithmatic with python datetime

6) notebook can take in sample magnitudes and datetimes and will now output a date range which is a list of tuples
