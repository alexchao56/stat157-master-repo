# Meeting notes:

- have suggested functions that would fit our plots
- make pretty plots
- need to bin by magnitude
  - binning is really hard to achieve
- add more years of catalogs
- create a ratio of magnitude/time elapsed multiplied by a contant k (which we need to tune)

#### Binning
- ```numpy.digitize```
  - http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.digitize.html
- ```numpy.arange```
  - http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html


### Show parallel graphs that show:

- a ratio of earthquakes that hit over earthquakes that miss within an alarm time
- and the cost of keeping the alarm time on over a period of time.

The goal is to see if there is a point where our ratio of hit/miss within a time frame is optimized at a minimum cost.

### Picture 2

Set the values within a bin that is considered within a range of time that is set as a ratio of magnitude to time elapsed. So higher magnitudes for an earthquakes leads to longer alarm times and we try to see how many earthquakes we can catch within the time frame. Any earthquakes with a higher magnitude than the original earthquake will not be considered an aftershock and will be considered "missed" by the time frame. We will try to optimize this value within a ratio later.

### Below picture shows how all the points within a bin are taken from the caught earthquakes within a time frame.
