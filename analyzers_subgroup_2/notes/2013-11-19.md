Error diagram 0-1 on axis for ETAs model 

Conditional intensity tells you how likely an earthquake will appear at any certain time

High values of lambda on left hand, lower on right

Think of it as threshold at which we turn on alarm

Work out a new tau pair for each new value of lambda

How do we evaluate nu and tau?

Tau is the proportion of time for the alarm being on if we turned it on when a value of intensity exceeds lambda

Nu is the proportion of earthquakes that your alarm would miss



Code set up for the temporal, space-time ETAs and strawman version with sensaible parameters

Spatial info is important for space-time ETAs and does better than just temporal ETAs

For a particular window length we can use interarrival times as the only thing in prediction and then deduce function lambda from interarrival times differentiate cdf to get pdf b/c absolute value of lambda doesnt matter for error diagram

Go from ETAs to MDA adjusting window lengths to magnitude. same principle

Time and magnitude variables from 1984-2010 measured in days

Started 18 June 2004 to collect data

Be careful of using e^x or 10^x for conditional intensity

Doesnt make a practical difference in what type of magnitude we use (body-wave and moment magnitudes)

Body-wave is more useful for larger magnitudes

Magnitude type matters in immediate aftermath of a big earthquake but otherwise doesn't have much impact

Take distribution of lambda of taus and lambda of nus to find parameters for error diagram
