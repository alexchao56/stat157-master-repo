# Fernando Lecture

Main takeaway: learned about the history of iPython and about how we can now upload a package that can run R in ipython

We can also create images, video, and voice interactive elements to our shell.

This presentation shows us that we can do so much more with iPython than we thought we could before this lecture.

Other notes:

REPL:

Read

Evaluate

Print

Loop


-Matlab, Mathematica, IDS, Python, etc. are used for specific purposes in integration and computation throughout time

Julia: numberical computation language created at MIT and taught at MIT

Going to create a pure R kernel in IPython so that you can completely run R in ipython.
