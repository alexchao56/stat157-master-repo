-Summary of ETAS-

ETAS model: A function to Ô¨Åt the space time epidemic type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model to a catalog (point pattern) of earthquakes and perform a stochastic declustering method.

    Model: etas(X, win, tperiod, m0, param0)

    X : Marked spatio-temporal point pattern  representing time, spatial location, magnitude and ... of earthquakes.
    win : Target geographical region of study. 
    Events outside this region are treated as complementary events in the log-likelihood.
    tperiod : Time period of quakes.
    m0 : Minimum magnitude threshold. A positive numeric value.
